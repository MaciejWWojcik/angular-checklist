title: don't call functions from the template to get data

# Problem

Templates often depend on dynamic data computed in their component classes, e.g. from an async service call, dynamic properties, etc. Therefore, it's essential to process the data and provide values for the template using component properties as opposed to function calls.

Angular can't predict whether the value returned from the function could change or not and by default it will call the function on every change detection cycle. Potentially in complex components, such functions could be called many times per second, resulting in poor performance.

Here are a couple of examples:

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <div>{{ getName() }}</div>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  id;

  getName() {
    return this.service.getName(this.id);
  }
}
```

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <button [disabled]="isDisabled()"></button>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  isDisabled() {
    return Math.random() > 0.5
  }
}
```

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <li *ngFor="let item of getItems()"></div>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  getItems() {
    return this.service.getBooks();
  }
}
```


# Solution

We can address this in a few ways:

- assign values to component properties
- use `OnPush` strategy
- use custom pipes

## Assigning values to component properties

Instead of calling a function from the template, we can call it in the component class when needed, and use the value to populate the component property:

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <div>{{ name }}</div>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  name;
  private id;

  ngOnInit() {
    this.name = this.getName();
  }

  getName() {
    return this.service.getName(this.id);
  }
}
```

That's why Angular will know the exact value of the property all the time, without any cost of checking that on every Change Detection!

## Using OnPush change detection strategy

Change Detection strategy describes how Angular should handle Change Detection and DOM rendering. When using OnPush strategy, the function will be called again only if `@Input` properties changes, or if `@Output` emiters are fired or an `Observable` emits new values.

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <div>{{ getName() }}</div>
  `,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class MyComponent {
  @Input() id;

  getName() {
    return this.service.getName(this.id);
  }
}
```

## Using custom pipes

Pipes by default are pure, which means Angular will execute its `transform` method only on change to the input value.
Here's an example:

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <div>{{ id | getName }}</div>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  id;
}
```
As long as the `id` property doesn't change the pipe won't execute its code again and perform a possibly expensive task.
